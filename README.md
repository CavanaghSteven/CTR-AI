# CTR-AI

This project implements an AI that is able to navigate the levels of the game 'Crash Team Racing' using only screen pixels as inputs.

These pixels are fed to a neural network that will find the correct output.

### Usage


Typical workflow will occur in the following order:


```
1) get_data.py

2) balance_data.py

3) train.py

4) inference.py

```
